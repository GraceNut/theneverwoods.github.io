    <h1>Ryan Johnson Recording</h1>
    <p>"The preceding two days proved to be one of the most challenging musical exploits Iâ€™d ever experienced, no clocks to tell us when to quit, no windows to let the blazing daylight in. Take after take we were torn apart, and we meticulously reconstructed ideas to leave the studio with a product we would be proud of." </p>
