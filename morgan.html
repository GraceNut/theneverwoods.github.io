    <h1>Morgan Sessions Photography</h1>
    <p>Morgan Sessions focuses on capturing love and life and stories all in a still moment of time, from the exitement of a marriage to the calmness of nature. She came to us because she had outgrown her old brand and needed more from her website. We worked with her to understand her professional needs and to find a direction for her new brand and site. In the end we decided on a hand-drawn logo to capture her love for adventure that agreed with her personality. The site was was designed to accent the stories she told with her photoshoots, and it was built on Squarespace so she could easily manage it. </p>
